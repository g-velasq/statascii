\title{statascii: Create Stata-like Tables in the R Console}
\description{
Create Stata-like tables in the R console, including right-aligned text, Stata-like padding, various Stata table formats (`oneway`, `twoway`, and `summary`), and Unicode box drawing characters. 'statascii()' borrows heavily from 'asciify()'. The 'asciify()' function was written by @gavinsimpson in StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13011383) and GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/gavinsimpson). The 'statascii()' function was first written by @gvelasq2 in Github Gist (https://gist.github.com/gvelasq2).
